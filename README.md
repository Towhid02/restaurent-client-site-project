Designing a restaurant website involves incorporating features that enhance user experience and provide essential information. Here are five main features to consider for your restaurant website project:

- Menu Display: Include a well-organized and visually appealing menu section. You can use images and descriptions for each dish. Consider categorizing items by type (appetizers, main courses, desserts) for easy navigation.

- Online Reservation System: Implement a reservation system that allows customers to book a table online. This feature can enhance user convenience and help you manage reservations more efficiently. Include a calendar with available time slots and a form for customers to fill out.

- Responsive Design: Ensure your website is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Many users access websites from mobile devices, so having a mobile-friendly design is crucial for a positive user experience.

- High-Quality Images: Showcase your restaurant and dishes with high-quality images. Visual appeal is essential in the food industry, and quality images can entice visitors to try your offerings. Consider professional photography for key menu items and the restaurant's ambiance.

- Contact Information and Location: Clearly display your restaurant's contact information, including phone number, email, and physical address. Include an embedded map or a link to a map service so visitors can easily find your location. If you have multiple branches, provide information for each.

These features provide a solid foundation for a restaurant website, but you can also consider additional elements based on your specific needs. For example, you might want to incorporate online ordering, a blog with updates and promotions, or integration with social media platforms to engage with your customers. Always keep the user experience in mind when planning and implementing features for your restaurant website.
